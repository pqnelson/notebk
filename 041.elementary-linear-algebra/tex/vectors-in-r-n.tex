\section{Vectors in \texorpdfstring{$\RR^{n}$}{Rn}}\label{section:vectors-in-r-n}

\M
We learn about vectors at university specifically so we could do vector
calculus. But we have only mentioned vectors in our notes on linear
algebra in passing as a particular ``species'' of matrices. Is this an
unfortunate collision of language? That is to say, are these two notions
distinct [not secretly the same] but unfortunately use the same term?

Let us review what a ``vector'' was for the real plane $\RR^{2}$.

\N{Real Number Line}
Let us recall what happens in the simplest case of all: the real number
line. The first thing we do is draw a line (in the Euclidean sense,
which extends in both directions infinitely far) and pick some point $O$
on the line:
\begin{center}
  \includegraphics{img/img.0}
\end{center}
We then pick a point $A\neq O$ on the line (which is not the same point
as $O$):
\begin{center}
  \includegraphics{img/img.1}
\end{center}
We take the distance between point $O$ and $A$ to be 1 unit. We then
construct the rest of the ``ticks'' along this line, and identify every
point with a number in the real numbers. Intuitively corresponding to
the picture:
\begin{center}
  \includegraphics{img/img.2}
\end{center}
How do we make this identification? We take a point $P$ on the line,
find its distance [from $O$ to $P$] as a multiple of the distance from
$O$ to $A$. In the case where, like point $Q$, it lies ``in the other
direction'', we identify point $Q$ with the negative real numbers by
dividing the distance between $O$ and $Q$ with the distance between $O$
and $A$ (and multiplying the result by $-1$). This is a real number
$x\in\RR$. Conversely, if $x\in\RR$, then we can identify with a point
on the line by dilating the line segment $\overline{OA}$ by $x$.

When we identify point $P$ on the line by the real number $x$, we call
$x$ the \define{Coordinate} of $P$. The point $O$ has coordinate $0$,
and the distance between points $P$ and $Q$ (who have coordinates
$x_{P}$ and $x_{Q}$, respectively) by the magnitude of the difference in
their coordinates $|x_{Q}-x_{P}|$.

\N{Constructing the Plane}
We can construct the plane by taking a line which passes through $O$ and
forms a $90^{\circ}$ angle with our real line. If we just ``plop'' down
such a line, we get:
\begin{center}
\includegraphics{img/img.3}
\end{center}
We can then form ``ticks'' along this new line, and call it the
\define{$y$ Axis} (our old line is the \define{$x$ Axis}):
\begin{center}
\includegraphics{img/img.4}
\end{center}
Instead of identifying a point in the plane with \emph{one} real number,
we now have a \emph{pair} of real numbers. These are obtained by
projecting onto the axes (the projection to the $x$-axis is in red, the
projection to the $y$-axis is in green):
\begin{center}
\includegraphics{img/img.5}
\end{center}
These give us points on the axes, which then give us coordinates $x_{P}$
and $y_{P}$ for those points on the axes. We combine these in an ordered
pair $(x_{P}, y_{P})$ and call them the \define{Coordinates} of $P$.
Conversely, given any pair of numbers $(x,y)\in\RR^{2}$, we can
construct a point in the plane by reversing the steps in this procedure.

\N{Vectors in the Plane}
Recall, we define a column 2-vector as a $2\times1$ matrix
\begin{equation}
\vec{v} = \begin{pmatrix}x_{1}\\x_{2}
\end{pmatrix}.
\end{equation}
We identify $\vec{p}$ with a point in the plane by constructing an
oriented line segment from $O$ (the point with coordinates $(0,0)$ in
the plane) and the point $P$ (with coordinates $(x_{1},x_{2})$). We
write this oriented line segment using the notation
$\overrightarrow{OP}$. We call $O$ the \define{Base Point} and $P$ the
\define{Endpoint} of $\overrightarrow{OP}$.
\begin{center}
\includegraphics{img/img.6}
\end{center}
The directed line segment $\overrightarrow{OP}$ has a \define{Direction} (given
by the angle formed with the positive $x_{1}$-axis) and a
\define{Magnitude} (given by its length).

We identify any directed line segment $\overrightarrow{OP}$ with base
point $O$ with a vector $\vec{v}$ by taking the components of $\vec{v}$
to be the coordinates of $P$ relative to base-point $O$.

Conversely, given any 2-vector $\vec{v}=(v_{1},v_{2})$, we identify it
with a directed line segment [in the plane with axes and units] from $O$
to $P$ where $P$ has coordinates $(v_{1},v_{2})$.

\begin{ddanger}\textsc{Caution:}
In physics, we often work with vectors with base point $Q$ and endpoint
$P$ in the plane (or in $\RR^{3}$ or wherever) and quite cavalierly
identify the oriented line segment $\overrightarrow{QP}$ with the line
segment of equal length and direction $\overrightarrow{OP'}$ located at
base-point $O$. This works because of the magic of $\RR^{n}$ being a
flat manifold. It doesn't work in general. In fact, in linear algebra,
we anchor all vectors to the same base point $O$.
\end{ddanger}

\begin{definition}
Let $\vec{v}=(v_{1},v_{2})$ be a vector in the plane. We define its
\define{Magnitude} by the non-negative real number
$\|\vec{v}\| = \sqrt{v_{1}^{2}+v_{2}^{2}}$.
\end{definition}

\N{Parallelogram Law}
When we have two vectors $\vec{u}$ and $\vec{v}$ in the plane (or in space), we can form a
parallelogram using vectors $\vec{u}$ and $\vec{v}$ as edges and their
shared base point as the origin. Their sum
is the vector to the opposite diagonal vertex from the origin:
\begin{center}
  \includegraphics{img/img.7}
\end{center}
The reader may verify the origin plus the two vectors give us three
vertices, and demanding a parallelogram gives us the remaining
vertex. Further, the coordinates of the remaining vertex may be obtained
by adding componentwise the coordinates of the endpoints for the vectors.

\begin{remark}
Fascinatingly, this ``parallelogram law'' is mistakenly attributed to
Pseudo-Aristotle, but recent scholarship shows this is a
misunderstanding. The first uses of the parallelogram law may be found
in Fermat (of ``Last Theorem'' fame) and Thomas Hobbes (the pessimistic ``rude,
short, and brutish'' philosopher). For further details, the reader is
invited to enjoy David Marshall Miller's
``The Parallelogram Rule from Pseudo-Aristotle to Newton''
\journal{Archive for History of Exact Sciences} \volume{71} (2017) pp.157--191.
\end{remark}

\N{Scalar Multiplication}
If we have a vector $\vec{v}$ corresponding to the oriented line segment
$\overrightarrow{OP}$ and a real number $r$, we may form the
scalar multiple $r\vec{v}$ by three cases:
\begin{enumerate}
\item Case 1 $r>0$: we just move the endpoint along the line passing
  through $O$ and $P$ to have a magnitude $r$ times greater than what
  the magnitude of $\overrightarrow{OP}$ is;
\item Case 2 $r=0$: we have the coordinates of the resulting vector be
  all zeroes.
\item Case 3 $r<0$: we find $Q$ the point along the line passing
  through $O$ and $P$ of the same magnitude but opposite direction of
  $\overrightarrow{OP}$, and multiply the magnitude of the line segment
  from $O$ to this new point $Q$ by $|r|>0$ to produce a point $R$ and
  identify $\overrightarrow{OR}$ with our new vector.
\end{enumerate}

\N{Consistency and Coherence Checks: Vector Subtraction}
We now may observe, for any vectors $\vec{u}$ and $\vec{v}$ in the
plane, that $\vec{u}-\vec{v}$ corresponds to the vector sum of $\vec{u}$
with the scalar multiple $-1\vec{v}$. Similarly, repeatedly adding a
vector $\vec{u}$ to itself $n\in\NN$ times gives us the scalar multiple
$n\vec{u}$.

In other words, scalar multiplication produces results which make sense
in light of vector addition \emph{via} the parallelogram law.

\N{Angles Between Vectors}
We can recall the law of cosines from trigonometry:
\begin{equation}
\|\vec{u}-\vec{v}\|^{2} = \|\vec{u}\|^{2} + \|\vec{v}\|^{2} - 2 \|\vec{u}\|\|\vec{v}\|\cos(\theta)
\end{equation}
where $\theta$ is the angle formed between the edges of the vector. We
refresh our memory of the location of the variables with the sketch:
\begin{center}
  \includegraphics{img/img.8}
\end{center}
Now, we can compute using coordinates
\begin{subequations}
\begin{calculation}
  \|\vec{u}-\vec{v}\|^{2}
\step{by definition of the magnitude of a vector}
  (u_{1}-v_{1})^{2} + (u_{2}-v_{2})^{2}
\step{expanding the terms}
  (u_{1}^{2}-2u_{1}v_{1}+v_{1}^{2}) + (u_{2}^{2}-2u_{2}v_{2}+v_{2}^{2})
\step{associativity of addition}
  (u_{1}^{2} + u_{2}^{2}) + (v_{1}^{2} + v_{2}^{2}) -2u_{1}v_{1}-2u_{2}v_{2}
\step{distributivity}
  (u_{1}^{2} + u_{2}^{2}) + (v_{1}^{2} + v_{2}^{2}) -2(u_{1}v_{1}+u_{2}v_{2}).
\end{calculation}
\end{subequations}
We see this is just
$\|\vec{u}\|^{2}+\|\vec{v}\|^{2}-2(\mbox{stuff})$. But we know what the
``(stuff)'' is, by the law of cosines,
\begin{equation}
-2(u_{1}v_{1}+u_{2}v_{2}) = - 2 \|\vec{u}\|\|\vec{v}\|\cos(\theta),
\end{equation}
hence \emph{for nonzero vectors} we find,
\begin{equation}
\frac{(u_{1}v_{1}+u_{2}v_{2})}{\|\vec{u}\|\|\vec{v}\|} = \cos(\theta).
\end{equation}
But what's more, we see the numerator of the right-hand side is just the
dot product of vectors $\vec{u}\cdot\vec{v}$. We conclude
\begin{equation}
\frac{\vec{u}\cdot\vec{v}}{\|\vec{u}\|\|\vec{v}\|} = \cos(\theta).
\end{equation}
We see this formula is symmetric if we switched places of $\vec{u}$ and
$\vec{v}$, in the sense we get exactly the same result.

But further, we can now \emph{define} the angle $\theta$ between
\emph{any} two \emph{nonzero}(!!) vectors $\vec{u}$ and $\vec{v}$ by the
relation: 
\begin{equation}
\boxed{\cos(\theta) := \frac{\vec{u}\cdot\vec{v}}{\|\vec{u}\|\|\vec{v}\|}.}
\end{equation}
We stress these must be nonzero vectors (otherwise we divide by zero and
horrible results follow).

\begin{definition}
If two nonzero vectors $\vec{u}$ and $\vec{v}$ are such that
\begin{equation}
\vec{u}\cdot\vec{v}=0,
\end{equation}
then we call them \define{Orthogonal} (usually we say one is orthogonal
to the other).
\end{definition}

\N{Unit Vectors and Directions}
If we wish to make a statement about ``directions'', then we can make it
precise by using \define{Unit Vectors} --- vectors of ``unit magnitude''
(i.e., length one). We follow tradition and use hats to indicate we have
a unit vector. For any nonzero vector $\vec{u}$ of arbitrary length, we
can \define{Normalize} it to produce the unit vector
\begin{equation}
\widehat{\vec{u}} = \frac{\vec{u}}{\|\vec{u}\|}.
\end{equation}
We see then that the angle between vectors may be found using their unit
vectors's dot product, without worrying about dividing by anything:
\begin{equation}
\widehat{\vec{u}}\cdot\widehat{\vec{v}}=\cos(\theta).
\end{equation}

\N{Generalization to $n>2$}
Everything we have discussed so far has been restricted to the real
plane $\RR^{2}$. But we could generalize it to $\RR^{n}$ for $n\in\NN$
arbitrary [but fixed]. Vectors then have $n$ components, but all our
definitions generalize accordingly. Vector addition is given by adding
components, scalar multiplication is given by multiplying each component
by the given scalar, and so on.
