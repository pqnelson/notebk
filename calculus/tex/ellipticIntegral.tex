\section{Elliptic Integrals and Elliptic Functions}
\M
As a warm up, lets try to consider the properties of a function
\begin{equation}
s(x)=\int^{x}_{0}\frac{\D u}{1-u^{2}}
\end{equation}
We should recall this is the arc-sine function. How do we study
its properties? Well, through its inverse function $\sin(u)$. 

\M
Consider the following function
\begin{equation}
F(\varphi) =
\int^{\varphi}_{0}\frac{\D u}{(1-u^{2})(1-k^{2}u^{2})}
\end{equation}
We should observe immediately that
\begin{equation}
F(0)=0.
\end{equation}
But observe this is just a \emph{deformation} of the warm-up!
