\section*{Concluding Remarks}

We have just covered quite a bit in excrutiating detail, but you should have 
some idea of how to compute Feynman diagrams now. This is actually more than
enough to have you begin reading books like Peskin and Schroeder~\cite{peskinSchroeder}, and that was
the secret hope and aim of this paper. 

Perhaps in the future, we will include a section on being able to read the
Feynman rules and begin computing directly from that; or perhaps a discussion of
non-Abelian gauge theories in the Feynman diagrams. Or to derive Feynman rules
from the Lagrangian alone! Who knows what the future will hold...
