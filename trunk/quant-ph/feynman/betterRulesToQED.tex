\subsection{Better Rules to the Game}

It should be obvious that the use of spinors has kind of fowled things up! That
is, we are kind of thrown a curve ball and we don't know whether we should do
things the way we did them with the toy model or whether we should try something
else. 

We are actually going to try something else, because it's easier to set up
the integral differently. We will evaluate external legs with vertices:
