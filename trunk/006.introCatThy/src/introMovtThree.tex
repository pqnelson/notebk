We continue this movement by introducing some more structure on a
category. We'll do this in a sort of unique way: first we'll
introduce the notions of cones and limits. Then we'll introduce a
number of interesting structure as \emph{examples} of cones and
limits! 

In particular, the examples which we'll cover are products of
categories, pullbacks, and equalizers (as well as terminal
objects). The manner which we'll cover these exotic structures is
(appropriately enough) in the manner of a minuet --- we'll dance
back and forth over the definition, giving examples of each
structure, and (hopefully) some examples reasoning with such things.
