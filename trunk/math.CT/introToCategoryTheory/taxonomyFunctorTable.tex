\begin{tabular}{| p{2.5cm} | p{6cm} |}
\hline
\textbf{Functor Property} & \textbf{What it means}\\\hline
Amnestic & Reflects identities.\\ \hline
Equivalence & Full, Faithful, and Isomorphism-Dense.\\\hline
Embedding & Injective on morphisms.\\ \hline
Faithful & Hom-set restrictions are injective\\ \hline
Full & Hom-set restrictions are surjective\\ \hline
Isomorphism & Bijective on morphisms and objects.\\\hline
Isomorphism-Dense & For each object in the domain, its image in
the codomain is isomorphic to an object in the domain.\\\hline
& (Alternatively) It's invertible. \\ \hline
& (Alternatively) It's an equivalence relation on the
conglomerate of all categories (i.e. the domain and codomain are
``essentially the same'').\\ \hline
