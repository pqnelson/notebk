A review of the ADM Hamiltonian formalism for classical General
Relativity.

Just a few remarks on notation. Latin indices $i,j,\ldots$ will
be for spatial components of four-tensors, Greek indices
$\alpha,\beta,\ldots$ will be for spacetime components of
four-tensors.

We will approach the subject of the Hamiltonian formulation of
general relativity (also known as canonical formulation of
gravity, canonical dynamics for general relatvity, canonical
gravity, among countless other names -- canonical here refers to
the use of Hamiltonian formalism as opposed to the Lagrangian
formalism) by the following process. %first reviewing the notion of hypersurfaces. 
%We will then apply this to the 
We will perform the decomposition of spacetime into space
plus time, or the ADM form of the metric. Given such a
decomposition, we look at how the Lagrangian gives way to the
Hamiltonian formalism. Then we review the constraints of General
Relativity, both the Hamiltonian and Momentum constraints.
