This originally started as an attempt to understand the details behind
exceptional Lie groups, following the outline and sketches of Adams's
book. Mostly out of frustration that Adams's book really was his lecture
notes, which I'm sure made sense to him, but I found lacking adequate
detail and explanation. Further, Adams's proofs were really more like
sketches of algorithms for constructions, in the sense that they are
used later on [albeit implicitly] in later proofs.

At the same time, there are other constructions of exceptional Lie
groups which emerged over the years. For example, Feingold and
friends~\cite{Feingold:1991:spinor-e8} have a spinor construction of the
$E_{8}$. 
John Baez~\cite{Baez:2001dm} wrote a beautiful review of the Octonions
(arguably, \emph{the} review paper of the Octonions) which includes
connections to the exceptional Lie groups.
