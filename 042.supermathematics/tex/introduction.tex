\section{Introduction}

\M I was reflecting upon my notes, and realized how much I enjoyed
taking courses from Dr Albert Schwarz while at UC Davis. I also wanted
to review supermathematics.

\M
We will study supermathematics by means of puzzles and exercises.
``Puzzles'' are more ``longterm'' questions to ponder, which we may
answer in future sections. ``Exercises'' are questions I want you to
answer as you read them. Or, if we think of this article as a road
trip, the ``puzzles'' are ``mileage signs'' and the ``exercises'' are the
next offramp.
