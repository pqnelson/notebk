\chapter{Special Relativity}

\M
There's a heuristic taught to graduate students:
\begin{equation}
\begin{pmatrix}\mbox{Quantum}\\
\mbox{Field}\\
\mbox{Theory}
\end{pmatrix}
=
\begin{pmatrix}\mbox{Special}\\
\mbox{Relativity}
\end{pmatrix}
+\begin{pmatrix}\mbox{Quantum}\\
\mbox{Mechanics}
\end{pmatrix}.
\end{equation}
This is partially true, but we should review special relativity (if only
to specify our conventions).

Historically, 
\begin{equation}
\begin{pmatrix}\mbox{Special}\\
\mbox{Relativity}
\end{pmatrix}
=
\begin{pmatrix}\mbox{Newtonian}\\
\mbox{Mechanics}
\end{pmatrix}
+
(\mbox{Electromagnetism}).
\end{equation}
This is because electromagnetism determines that the speed of light is
constant in a vacuum, and Newtonian mechanics assumes Galilean
relativity. But what happens if an inertial observer is moving at the
speed of light? Addition of velocities would suggest that bodies could
move faster than light\footnote{Einstein's thought experiment: suppose
you were riding on a bicycle going $0.999c$, and then you turn on your
headlights. What speed will the photons emitted from your headlights
travel?}, which violates results from electromagnetism.

\section{Foundations}

\begin{axiom}[Principle of Relativity]
The laws of physics are identical in all inertial frames. That is to
say, the outcome of any physical experiment is the same when performed
with identical initial conditions relative to any inertial frame.
\end{axiom}

\begin{axiom}
There exists an inertial reference frame in which light signals in
vacuum always travel rectilinearly at constant speed $c$, in all
directions, independently of the motion of the source.
\end{axiom}

\begin{remark}
These are the axioms as formulated in Rinder~\cite[\S4]{Rindler:1991sr}.
Traditionally, introductory texts to special relativity use some version
of these axioms, then ``derive'' results in special relativity.

A more intuitive approach uses $K$-calculus, as first formulated by
Bondi, using spacetime diagrams.
\end{remark}

\section{Kinematics}

\N{Four-Vectors} Special relativity differs from Newtonian physics by
working with 4-vectors. The usual vectors we encountered in physics
$\vec{x}$ are 3-vectors in physical space. Now we will use 4-component
vectors of the form $(t, \vec{x})$ or more generally using indices
$(x^{0}, x^{1}, x^{2}, x^{3})$. We can write this using basis vectors
\begin{subequations}
\begin{align}
  A &= (A^{0}, A^{1}, A^{2}, A^{3})\\
&= A^{0}\vec{e}_{0} + A^{1}\vec{e}_{1} + A^{2}\vec{e}_{2} + A^{3}\vec{e}_{3}\\
&= A^{0}\vec{e}_{0} + A^{i}\vec{e}_{i}\\
&= A^{\mu}\vec{e}_{\mu}
\end{align}
\end{subequations}
where $\vec{e}_{\mu}$ are basis vectors, we implicitly sum over repeated
indices, $i = 1,2,3$, and $\mu=0,1,2,3$.

The zeroth component is the time component, the remaining components are
the spatial components.

\begin{remark}
When the components of the four-vector are upstairs $A^{\mu}$,
these are \define{Contravariant} vectors.
\end{remark}

\N{Covectors}
We can also consider ``covectors'' or ``dual vectors'' (which eat in a
4-vector and produce a [real] number). These have components with
downstairs indices $B_{\mu}\vec{f}^{\mu}$ where $\vec{f}^{\mu}$ are the
co-basis covectors.

\M
Normally we can transform the components of a four-vector
$\vec{A}=A^{\mu}\vec{e}_{\mu}$ into the components of a covector by
using the metric $g_{\mu\nu}$ in the usual way:
\begin{equation}
A_{\nu}\vec{f}^{\nu} = (g_{\mu\nu}A^{\mu})\vec{f}^{\nu}.
\end{equation}
We can do the same, but for special relativity the metric is denoted
$\eta_{\mu\nu}$.\marginpar{\footnotesize Minkowski metric $\eta_{\mu\nu}$}
We call this the \define{Minkowski metric} and in Cartesian coordinates
has components
\begin{equation}
\eta_{\mu\nu} = \begin{pmatrix}-1 & 0 & 0 & 0\\
0 & 1 & 0 & 0\\
0 & 0 & 1 & 0\\
0 & 0 & 0 & 1
\end{pmatrix}.
\end{equation}
This is the so-called \define{East-Coast Convention} (particle
physicists multiply this by $-1$ and that's the \emph{West-coast convention}).

\N{Magnitude of Four-Vectors}
When $a^{\mu}$ is any four-vector, its magnitude is the scalar quantity
given by:
\begin{equation}
\|a^{\mu}\|^{2} := \eta_{\mu\nu}a^{\mu}a^{\nu}.
\end{equation}

\begin{definition}
The \define{Four-Position} is the four-vector with components
\begin{equation*}
x^{\mu} = (ct, x^{1}, x^{2}, x^{3}).
\end{equation*}
In Cartesian coordinates, $x^{\mu} = (ct, x, y, z)$.
\end{definition}

\N{Events}
Events in spacetime are described using 4-position vectors. This is an
idealization that events have no ``duration''. We could handle events
with some duration by having one 4-position for the ``start'' and
another 4-position for the ``end''.

\begin{definition}
When we have two 4-position vectors $\vec{A}_{1}=(ct_{1},\vec{r}_{1})$
and $\vec{A}_{2}=(ct_{2},\vec{r}_{2})$, we define the
\define{Displacement Four-Vector} as the four-vector
\begin{equation*}
\Delta\vec{A} = (c\,\Delta t,\Delta\vec{r}) = \vec{A}_{2} - \vec{A}_{1}.
\end{equation*}
For an \define{Infinitesimal Displacement Four-Vector} (or
\emph{Differential Four-Position}), we write
$\D\vec{A}$.
\end{definition}

\M
Suppose we have two events in spacetime separated by an infinitesimal
displacement 4-vector $\D x^{\mu}$. Special relativity demands the
infinitesimal interval,
\begin{equation}
(\D s)^{2} := \eta_{\mu\nu}\,\D x^{\mu}\,\D x^{\nu} = -c^{2}(\D t)^{2} + (\D x)^{2} + (\D y)^{2} + (\D z)^{2},
\end{equation}
must be the same for all inertial observers. Here we use summation
conventions where, when we have an index downstairs and upstairs, we sum
over it (so in our equation, we sum over $\mu$ and $\nu$).

\begin{definition} Let $a^{\mu}$ be a 4-vector.
  \begin{enumerate}
  \item If $\eta_{\mu\nu}a^{\mu}a^{\nu} < 0$, then we call $a^{\mu}$ \define{Time-like}.
  \item If $\eta_{\mu\nu}a^{\mu}a^{\nu} = 0$, then we call $a^{\mu}$ \define{Light-like}.
  \item If $\eta_{\mu\nu}a^{\mu}a^{\nu} > 0$, then we call $a^{\mu}$ \define{Space-like}.
  \end{enumerate}
\end{definition}

\begin{remark}
To see the motivation for these definitions, consider the trajectory of
a photon moving along the $x$-axis in Cartesian coordinates. It would be
$\vec{\gamma}(t)=(ct,ct,0,0)$ and its displacement from the origin would
be always zero for any $t\in\RR$. Therefore, the displacement would be
light-like.

For time-like vectors, consider the displacement 4-vector
$\vec{\alpha}(t)=(ct,0,0,0)$ which stays at the spatial origin. We see
its magnitude is $-c^{2}t^{2}<0$.

For space-like vectors, consider the displacement 4-vector
$\vec{\beta}(t)=(0,ct,0,0)$. Its magnitude is $c^{2}t^{2}>0$.
\end{remark}

\begin{definition}[Minkowski spacetime]
We write $\RR^{3,1}$ for \define{Minkowski Spacetime}, i.e., $\RR^{4}$
equipped with the Minkowski metric $\eta$.
\end{definition}

\begin{remark}
If we were using $+---$ signature conventions, Minkowski space would be
$\RR^{1,3}$. 
\end{remark}

\begin{definition}\label{defn:relativity:light-cone}
Let $a^{\mu}$ be any event. We define the \define{Lightcone} for $a^{\mu}$
to be the set of events light-like separated from $a^{\mu}$,
\begin{equation}
\mathscr{C} = \{\,b^{\mu}\in\RR^{3,1} \mid b^{\mu}~\mbox{is light-like separated from}~a^{\mu}\,\}.
\end{equation}
We can separate the light-cone in two: events in the future and events
in the past, giving us the \define{Future Light Cone}
\begin{equation}
\mathscr{C}^{+} = \{\,b^{\mu}\in\mathscr{C} \mid b^{0} > a^{0}\,\},
\end{equation}
and the \define{Past Light Cone} consisting of events preceding $a^{\mu}$,
\begin{equation}
\mathscr{C}^{-} = \{\,b^{\mu}\in\mathscr{C} \mid b^{0} < a^{0}\,\}.
\end{equation}
We can take the \define{Closed Light Cone} to consist of all light-like
separated events \emph{and} all time-like separated events, and denote
it by
\begin{equation}
\overline{\mathscr{C}} = \{\,b^{\mu}\in\RR^{3,1} \mid \eta_{\mu\nu}(b^{\mu}-a^{\mu})(b^{\nu}-a^{\nu})\leq0\,\}.
\end{equation}
\end{definition}

\M
The only possible causal influences for an event $a^{\mu}$
\emph{must lie within the past causal light cone} for the event, since
nothing can travel faster than light. For this reason, we call any
four-vector $b^{\mu}$ \define{Causal-like} if it is not space-like
separated from $a^{\mu}$, i.e., if the displacement $b^{\mu} - a^{\mu}$
four-vector is either time-like or light-like.

\N{World lines}
A curve $\gamma$ in spacetime is called a \define{World Line}
if its tangent vector is future time-like at each point along the
curve. More generally, we could weaken the condition, and allow tangent
vectors to be causal-like.

Particles move along world lines in special relativity.

\M
If we have a curve $\gamma$ in spacetime such that its tangent vector is
space-like at each point along the curve, we call the curve
\define{Space-like}.

If we have a curve in spacetime such that its tangent vector is
ligh-like at each point along the curve, we call the curve
\define{Light-like}. 


\N{Proper Time}
The time between two events along a world line, according to the
observer moving along the trajectory, is precisely the
\define{Proper Time} and denoted $\tau$. For an infinitesimal
displacement along the trajectory, the infinitesimal change in proper
time is given by
\begin{equation}
c^{2}\,(\D\tau)^{2} = -(\D s)^{2}.
\end{equation}
The proper time interval along a trajectory is given by the integral
\begin{equation}
\Delta\tau = \int_{\gamma}\D\tau =
\int_{\gamma}\frac{\sqrt{-\eta_{\mu\nu}\,\D x^{\mu}\,\D x^{\nu}}}{c}.
\end{equation}

\N{Parametrizing World Lines}
We parametrize a world line by its proper time, and write it as
$x^{\mu}(\tau)$. This gives us a smooth family of four-positions for a
physical body.

\begin{definition}
Let $x^{\mu}(\tau)$ be a world line. We define its \define{Four-Velocity}
as the four-vector
\begin{equation*}
U^{\mu}(\tau) = \frac{\D x^{\mu}(\tau)}{\D\tau}.
\end{equation*}
\end{definition}

\begin{remark}
Whenever we are tempted to take the time derivative of a quantity, we
really want to take the derivative with respect to \emph{proper time}.
\end{remark}

\N{Lorentz Factor}
We have the familiar Newtonian 3-velocity given by
\begin{equation}
v^{i} = \frac{\D x^{i}}{\D t}.
\end{equation}
We can relate the coordinate time $x^{0}=ct$ with proper time $\tau$ by
the \define{Lorentz Factor} (which is a function of the Newtonian 3-velocity),
\begin{equation}
  \begin{split}
\gamma(\vec{v}) &= \frac{\D t}{\D\tau} = \left(1 - \frac{\eta_{ij}v^{i}v^{j}}{c^{2}}\right)^{-1/2}\\
&=\frac{c}{\sqrt{-\eta_{\mu\nu}U^{\mu}U^{\nu}}}.
  \end{split}
\end{equation}
This allows us to relate the familiar Newtonian 3-velocity
to the four-velocity by
\begin{equation}
U^{\mu} = (c, \gamma(\vec{v})\vec{v}).
\end{equation}

\section{Dynamics}

\M
Often the dynamics of particles are omitted in discussions of special
relativity, because things getting complicated conceptually.

\begin{definition}
Let $x^{\mu}(\tau)$ be the world line for a massive body.
Then the \define{Rest Mass} (or \emph{invariant mass}) for the body is
the mass $m_{0}$ as measured in its reference frame.
\end{definition}

\begin{remark}
Some authors use a notion of \emph{relativistic mass}
$m = \gamma(\vec{v})m_{0}$, which is mildly controversial. 
\end{remark}

\N{Four-Momentum}
For a massive particle of rest mass $m_{0}$, its \define{Four-Momentum}
$\vec{P}$ is defined as the product of the rest mass and its
four-velocity, i.e.,
\begin{equation}
\vec{P} := m_{0}\vec{U}.
\end{equation}
We can write out its explicit components
\begin{equation}
\vec{P} = m_{0}\gamma(\vec{v})(c, \vec{v}) = (E/c, \vec{p}).
\end{equation}
Here the total energy of the moving particle is given by
\begin{equation}
E = \gamma(\vec{v})m_{0}c^{2},
\end{equation}
and the total (relativistic) 3-momentum is
\begin{equation}
\vec{p} = m_{0}\gamma(\vec{v})\vec{v}.
\end{equation}

\N{Energy--Momentum Relation}
We have the energy--momentum relation (or \define{Mass--Shell Relation})
be
\begin{equation}
E^{2} = c^{2}\vec{p}\cdot\vec{p} + \bigl(m_{0}c^{2}\bigr)^{2}.
\end{equation}
Equivalently, we have this relation describe the magnitude of the
four-momentum as a constant:
\begin{equation}
\eta_{\mu\nu}p^{\mu}p^{\nu} = -m_{0}^{2}c^{2}.
\end{equation}

\begin{ddanger}
In special relativity, we can meaningfully talk about the Center-of-Mass
reference frame for a system of particles. This is especially useful for
scattering problems. However, if we tried to carry this notion over to
General Relativity, then we run into problems because it is a nonlocal
concept. 
\end{ddanger}

\begin{exercise}
From the mass-shell relation and $\vec{P} = (E/c, \vec{p})$, deduce
$E = \gamma(\vec{v})m_{0}c^{2}$ and 
$\vec{p}\cdot\vec{p}=\pm(\gamma(\vec{v})^{2}-1)m_{0}^{2}c^{2}$.
Determine the correct sign in that second relation.
\end{exercise}

\begin{exercise}
Suppose we have two massive particles with four-momenta $\vec{P}_{1}$
and $\vec{P}_{2}$ and relative speed $v$. Determine
$\vec{P}_{1}\cdot\vec{P}_{2}=\eta_{\mu\nu}P^{\mu}_{(1)}P^{\nu}_{(2)}$ in
terms of their rest mass $m_{01}$ and $m_{02}$ and relative speed $v$.
Hint: if $\vec{P}_{1}=\vec{P}_{2}$ and $v=0$, then you should recover
the mass--shell relation.
\end{exercise}

\N{Four-Force}
We can define the four-force as the four-vector
\begin{equation}
\vec{F} = \frac{\D\vec{P}}{\D\tau}.
\end{equation}
As an immediate consequence of the mass--shell relation, we find
\begin{equation}
\vec{F}\cdot\vec{P} = \eta_{\mu\nu}F^{\mu}P^{\nu} = 0.
\end{equation}

\N{Lagrangian for Point-Particle}
We can write the Lagrangian for a massive point-particle with rest mass
$m_{0}$ as
\begin{equation}
L = cm_{0}\sqrt{-\eta_{\mu\nu}\dot{x}^{\mu}\dot{x}^{\nu}} - V
\end{equation}
where $\dot{x}^{\mu} = \D x^{\mu}/\D\tau = U^{\mu}$, and $V$ is the potential
energy term. The action is then 
\begin{equation}
I = \int L\,\D\tau.
\end{equation}
Varying the action with respect to $\delta x^{\mu}$ then gives us the
equations of motion.

For massless particles, care must be taken with the parametrization, as
well as using its four-momentum to write
\begin{equation}
L = c\sqrt{-\eta_{\mu\nu}P^{\mu}P^{\nu}} - V.
\end{equation}
We can use the relation (which holds for both massive and massless particles):
\begin{equation}
\frac{\D x^{\mu}}{\D t} = \frac{P^{\mu}}{P^{0}}.
\end{equation}

\begin{danger}
This is the correct Lagrangian to work with, especially if we want to
quantize it. There is some subtlety with it, which we should confess
openly: it is a constrained system. To see this, compute the Hamiltonian
for a free massive relativistic particle. It will vanish. This is
because time is a coordinate (proper time is a parameter), and its
conjugate momentum is ``the Hamiltonian''. So we end up with a
constraint. 
\end{danger}

\begin{ddanger}
Some authors insist that canonical mechanics for special relativistic
systems ``breaks Lorentz invariance'', which is not really true. If
you've picked $\mu=0$ to be the time component for four-vectors, then
you've also ``broken Lorentz invariance'' just as much as canonical
mechanics has. We can describe a Lorentz boost as a canonical
transformation (which preserves Lorentz invariance as much as anything
else). This is just offered as a lazy and sloppy justification for using
the path integral formalism, which makes no coherent sense.
\end{ddanger}

\N{References}
For the uninitiated, Taylor and Wheeler~\cite{Taylor:1992sp} is a great
introduction. Rindler~\cite{Rindler:1991sr} is a good review.

\N{TODO: Lorentz Invariance}
I should specifically spell out what Lorentz invariance means, since
it's implicit but not done anywhere.

\N{TODO: Group Theory}
I should also mention the Lorentz and Poincar\'e groups, and how they
capture the essence of Lorentz invariance\dots because they're going to
be important in quantum field theory.

\N{TODO: Scattering}
It is probably good to discuss $2\to2$ scattering in special relativity,
since that's the basis of a lot of particle physics experiments.

\N{TODO: Electromagnetism}
I should also take some time to discuss the basics of electromagnetism
using a four-potential $A^{\mu}$ and the Maxwell field tensor
$F^{\mu\nu}$. After all, this serves as the basis for Yang--Mills theory
later on.
