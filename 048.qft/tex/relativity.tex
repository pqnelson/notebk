\chapter{Special Relativity}

\M
There's a heuristic taught to graduate students:
\begin{equation}
\begin{pmatrix}\mbox{Quantum}\\
\mbox{Field}\\
\mbox{Theory}
\end{pmatrix}
=
\begin{pmatrix}\mbox{Special}\\
\mbox{Relativity}
\end{pmatrix}
+\begin{pmatrix}\mbox{Quantum}\\
\mbox{Mechanics}
\end{pmatrix}.
\end{equation}
This is partially true, but we should review special relativity (if only
to specify our conventions).

Historically, 
\begin{equation}
\begin{pmatrix}\mbox{Special}\\
\mbox{Relativity}
\end{pmatrix}
=
\begin{pmatrix}\mbox{Newtonian}\\
\mbox{Mechanics}
\end{pmatrix}
+
(\mbox{Electromagnetism}).
\end{equation}
This is because electromagnetism determines that the speed of light is
constant in a vacuum, and Newtonian mechanics assumes Galilean
relativity. But what happens if an inertial observer is moving at the
speed of light? Addition of velocities would suggest that bodies could
move faster than light\footnote{Einstein's thought experiment: suppose
you were riding on a bicycle going $0.999c$, and then you turn on your
headlights. What speed will the photons emitted from your headlights
travel?}, which violates results from electromagnetism.

For the uninitiated, Taylor and Wheeler~\cite{Taylor:1992sp} is a great
introduction. Rindler~\cite{Rindler:1991sr} is a good review.
Misner, Thorne, and Wheeler's \textit{Gravitation}~\cite{Misner:1973prb} (ch.2) discusses
special relativity and we rely on its index notation conventions, and
Chapter 6 discusses accelerated observers in Special Relativity.
We also have double checked calculations against Srednicki~\cite{Srednicki:2007qs}.

There are a lot of subtleties to the Hamiltonian analysis of
electromagnetism and, more generally, any theory with symmetries. The
best review of the topic is the first 5 or so chapters of Henneaux and Teitelboim~\cite{Henneaux:1992ig}.

\N{TODO: Index Correct?}
I should double check the indices are correct for the Lorentz
transformation ${\Lambda^{\mu}}_{\nu}$ --- or is this the inverse of the
Lorentz transformation? After some investigation, we should have
$(\Lambda x)^{\mu} = {\Lambda^{\mu}}_{\nu}x^{\nu}$.
Rows are indexed by covariant indices, columns are indexed by
contravariant indices. MTW \S2.9 uses the notation
$x^{\alpha'} = {\Lambda^{\alpha'}}_{\mu}x^{\mu}$ and the inverse
transformation by $x^{\mu} = {\Lambda^{\mu}}_{\alpha'}x^{\alpha'}$.
Therefore composing these guys gives us
${\Lambda^{\mu}}_{\alpha'}{\Lambda^{\alpha'}}_{\nu}={\delta^{\mu}}_{\nu}$
and ${\Lambda^{\alpha'}}_{\mu}{\Lambda^{\mu}}_{\beta'} = {\delta^{\alpha'}}_{\beta'}$.

\N{TODO: Scattering}
It is probably good to discuss $2\to2$ scattering in special relativity,
since that's the basis of a lot of particle physics experiments.
