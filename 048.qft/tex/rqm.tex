\chapter{Relativistic Quantum Mechanics}

\M
We have reviewed nonrelativistic quantum mechanics, and we have
reviewed special relativity. The natural question: how can we construct
relativistic quantum mechanics? We follow
Ticciati~\cite{Ticciati:1999qp} in our discussion.

The basic idea is to use Wigner's Theorem~\ref{thm:wigner's-theorem}
and demand our quantum system enjoy invariance under the Poincar\'e group
(Definition~\ref{defn:relativity:poincare-group}).

\textsc{Caution:}
The reader should first solve
Exercise~\ref{xca:relativity:canonical-analysis-of-free-particle} before
reading Section~\ref{section:rqm:constrained-quantization-of-free-particle}.
