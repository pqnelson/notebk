\chapter{Classical Fields}

\M
The general idea is that we will review/introduce classical fields, then
appeal to an heuristic quantization procedure to obtain quantum fields.
The motivation is a careful derivation of the linear chain, where we
have an infinite number of identical point-masses connected by identical
massless springs. Taking the continuum limit gives us the scalar field.
