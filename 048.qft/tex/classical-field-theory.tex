\chapter{Classical Fields}

\M
The general idea is that we will review/introduce classical fields, then
appeal to an heuristic quantization procedure to obtain quantum fields.
The motivation is a careful derivation of the linear chain, where we
have an infinite number of identical point-masses connected by identical
massless springs. Taking the continuum limit gives us the scalar field.

Most fields can intuitively be imagined as a ``tuple of scalar fields''.
For example, electromagnetism has its field $A^{\mu}$ be a 4-tuple of
scalar fields which are related in some manner (e.g., enjoying Lorentz
invariance and satisfies the equations of motion). This is a lie, but a
comforting lie that physicists tell themselves.

\M
There is another, less discussed, derivation of classical fields from
demanding certain ``background independence'' properties. We can derive
gauge theory in this manner, too. Teitelboim~\cite{Teitelboim:1980hs}
wrote a review of this approach, and it appears to be folklore among
quantum gravity researchers (especially those working in the canonical
approaches). This requires accepting a few innocent axioms and working
within the Hamiltonian framework.
