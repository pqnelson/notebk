\section{Poincar\'e Algebra}

\N{Big Idea}
We study Lie groups by studying their Lie algebras (``infinitesimal
symmetries near the identity''), and we want to find finite-dimensional
unitary representations for the Poincar\'e group. It suffices for our
purposes to study the Lie algebra for the Lorentz group (which can be
extended to the Lie algebra for the Poincar\'e group by adjoining
generators of translations --- i.e., the momentum and Hamiltonian
operators). We want to find irreducible representations, since these
correspond to ``elementary'' quantum systems.

Wigner forwarded the interpretation that irreducible representations for
the ``Poincar\'e group'' should be viewed as elementary
particles.\index{Elementary Particle!As Irreducible Representation}

\begin{definition}
The subgroup of \define{Proper Orthochronous Lorentz Transformations}
denoted either as $\ISO(3,1)$ or $\SO^{+}(3,1)$, consists of Lorentz
transformations $\Lambda\in\O(3,1)$ such that
\begin{enumerate}
\item it is proper (``preserves orientation''): $\det(\Lambda)=+1$, and
\item it is orthochronous: ${\Lambda^{0}}_{0}\geq+1$.
\end{enumerate}
\end{definition}
\begin{exercise}
Prove the identity transformation is a proper orthochronous Lorentz
transformation. 
\end{exercise}

\N{Non-examples}
There are two critical example:
\begin{enumerate}
\item The transformation of time reversal $T=\diag(-1,1,1,1)$ is not an
  orthochronous Lorentz transformation (but it is a Lorentz transformation).
\item Parity reversal $P=\diag(1,-1,-1,-1)$ is a Lorentz transformation
  but it is not proper.
\end{enumerate}
Composing these two operators does not give us a proper orthochronous
Lorentz transformation. But in four dimensions, the Lorentz group
$\O(3,1)$ has four connected components, and applying $P$, $T$, $PT$ to
the identity component gives us the other three. Therefore, we can work
with an arbitrary proper orthochronous Lorentz transformation
$\Lambda\in\ISO(3,1)$ then $P\Lambda$, $T\Lambda$, $PT\Lambda$ gives us
arbitrary Lorentz transformations \emph{in four dimensions}.

\N{Obtaining the Lorentz Lie Algebra}
It's a common trick to parametrize a proper orthochronous Lorentz
transformation $\Lambda\in\ISO(3,1)$ using 
``angles'' [scalars], just as we would with rotations, as
\begin{equation}
{\Lambda^{\mu}}_{\nu} = [\exp\left(\frac{-\I}{2}\omega_{\kappa\lambda}M^{\kappa\lambda}\right)]{{}^{\mu}}_{\nu}
\end{equation}
where $\omega_{\kappa\lambda}=-\omega_{\lambda\kappa}$ are ``rotation
angles'' (real constants parametrizing the symmetry) and
$M^{\kappa\lambda}$ is an indexed family of matrices (i.e., fix a value
of $\kappa$ and $\lambda$, and you get a $4\times4$ matrix). These $M^{\kappa\lambda}$ are
generators of the Lie algebra for the Lorentz group. Explicitly
\begin{equation}
(M^{\kappa\lambda})_{\mu\nu} = \I(\delta^{\kappa}_{\mu}\delta^{\lambda}_{\nu}-\delta^{\kappa}_{\nu}\delta^{\lambda}_{\mu})
\end{equation}
Now the trick is that we can write the generators of the Lorentz Lie
algebra using
\begin{subequations}
\begin{align}
L^{i} &= \frac{1}{2}\epsilon^{ijk}M_{jk}\\
\intertext{for spatial rotations, and}
K^{i} &= M^{0i}%\\
%% \intertext{for Lorentz boosts. We define}
%% \vec{J}_{\pm} &= \frac{1}{2}(\vec{L}\pm\I\vec{K}).
\end{align}
\end{subequations}

\N{Complexified Lorentz Lie Algebra}
We are really interested in the irreducible complex linear
representations of the complexification $\iso(3,1)_{\CC}$ of the Lie
algebra $\iso(3,1)$ of the Lorentz group. This is because the Lorentz
group is non-compact (which makes it impossible to obtain a
finite-dimensional Unitary representation), so we change the goal to
find holomorphic representations of the complexified Lie Algebra for the
Lorentz group. This is precisely Weyl's Unitarian trick.

We define
\begin{equation}
\vec{J}_{\pm} = \frac{1}{2}(\vec{L}\pm\I\vec{K}).
\end{equation}
The reader may verify the commutation relations become
\begin{equation}
[J^{i}_{\pm}, J^{j}_{\pm}] = \I\epsilon^{ijk}J^{k}_{\pm}.
\end{equation}
But now look, this is precisely two copies of the complexified Lie
algebra $\su(2)_{\CC}$ (each copy is isomorphic to $\sl(2,\CC)$)
parametrized by the ``$\pm$'' subscripts.

Thus by the Unitarian trick, we can study representations of $\iso(3,1)$
by means of representations for $\su(2)_{\CC}$. Specifically
highest-weight representations of $\su(2)_{\CC}$.

\M
The punchline:
\textit{Each irreducible representation of $\iso(3,1)$
is characterized by a pair of half-integers $(j_{+}, j_{-})$.} We can
interpret these irreducible representations as particles, summarized by
the handy-dandy table:

\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{c|c|c}
  $(j_{+}, j_{-})$ & Name of Field & Dimension of Rep \\\hline
  $(0, 0)$ &	Scalar  &	1\\
$(1/2, 0)$ & 	Left-handed Weyl Spinor &	2\\
$(0, 1/2)$ &	Right-handed Weyl Spinor &	2\\
$(1, 0)$ &	(Imaginary) Self-dual 2-form &	3\\
$(0, 1)$ &	(Imaginary) Anti-self-dual 2-form &	3\\
$(1/2, 1/2)$ &	Vector (gauge field) &	4\\
$(1/2, 1)$ & 	Left-Handed Rarita-Schwinger field &	6\\
$(1, 1/2)$ &	Right-Handed Rarita-Schwinger field &	6\\
$(1, 1)$ &	Graviton (spin-2 field) &	9
\end{tabular}
\end{center}

Quantum Field Theory studies merely three such representations:
\begin{itemize}
\item $(0,0)$ the scalar particle,
\item $(1/2,0)\oplus(0,1/2)$ Dirac fermionic particle, and
\item $(1/2, 1/2)$ vector (gauge Boson) particles.
\end{itemize}

\N{Infinite-Dimensional Unitary Representations}
Finite-dimensional representations have Lorentz transformations act on
finite-dimensional constant vectors. If we want to have Lorentz
transformations act on a multi-component field $\Phi_{a}(t,\vec{x})$,
then we need a Unitary infinite-dimensional representation for the
Lorentz group (or Poincar\'e group), something like:
\begin{equation}
\Phi_{a}\xrightarrow{\Lambda}\sum_{b}M_{ab}(\Lambda)\Phi_{b}
\end{equation}
where $M(\Lambda)$ treats the components of the field as components of a
constant vector. This is close but incomplete, we can also transform the
spacetime position:
\begin{equation}
\Phi_{a}(x)\xrightarrow{\Lambda}\sum_{b}M_{ab}(\Lambda)\Phi_{b}(\Lambda^{-1}x).
\end{equation}
As a ``smoke check'', we see that a scalar field is just a function on
spacetime $\psi(x)$, and a representation of a group $G$ on function space
gives
\begin{equation}
\forall g\in G, \rho(g)\psi(x)=\psi(g^{-1}\cdot x)
\end{equation}
where there's an ``obvious'' representation of $G$ on the domain of $\psi$.
And behold: the Poincar\'e group acts in an obvious way on space-time!
