\chapter{Grand Unified Theories}

\M
Graham Ross's \textit{Grand Unified Theories} is one of the only books
on the subject; it was originally written in 1985, and much has changed
since then.

There is also Rabindra Mohapatra's \textit{Unification and Supersymmetry: The Frontiers of Quark-Lepton Physics},
which is more recent.

Baez and Heurta~\cite{Baez:2009dj} review of the algebra behind grand
unified theories.
