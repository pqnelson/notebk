\M
This is the book I wish I had when learning quantum field theory.
It's probably not a good introduction to the subject, since the
conventions are idiosyncratic and subject material oriented towards
quantum gravity (rather than particle physics).

My interests have shifted over time, and I add material which piques my
interest at the time of writing.

\N{Starred sections}
Starred sections are optional ``fluff'' or background, which is
interesting but tangential. They may be skipped on first reading.
