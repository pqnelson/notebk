\title{Quantum Field Theory}
\date{November 20, 2022}
\begin{document}

\maketitle

\begin{abstract}
This is a summary of the conceptual aspects of quantum field theory. A
lot of calculations will be omitted or sketched out. Many calculations
may be found explicitly in Hatfield~\cite{Hatfield:1992rz}. We instead
focus on the usefulness of Lie algebras and Lie groups in quantum field
theory.

Since most of the \emph{conceptual} aspects may be discussed in the
classical setting, we spend a lot of time reviewing classical field
theory and analogous phenomena at the classical level.
