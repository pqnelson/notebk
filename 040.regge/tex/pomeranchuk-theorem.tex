\N{Imaginary Part of $s$-Channel Amplitude}
Gribov writes $\Im_{s}\amplitude(s,t)$ for the imaginary part of the
$s$-channel amplitude, which is frustratingly vague. What he means is
the following: recall the Schwarz reflection principle in complex
analysis (see the preceding lemma for a formal statement), where if
$f\colon U\subset\CC\to\CC$ is defined on a
neighborhood $U\cap\RR\neq\emptyset$, then we can extend it by
$f(z^{*})=(f(z))^{*}$.
We do the same, finding
\begin{equation}\label{eq:defn:discontinuity-in-s-channel}
2\I\Im_{s}(\amplitude(s+\I\varepsilon,t)) = \amplitude(s+\I\varepsilon,t)-\amplitude(s-\I\varepsilon,t),
\end{equation}
taking the $\varepsilon\to0$ limit on both sides.
Other authors call the right-hand side of Eq~\eqref{eq:defn:discontinuity-in-s-channel} the discontinuity in the $s$-channel and denote
it $D_{s}(s,t,u)$.
