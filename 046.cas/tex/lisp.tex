\chapter{Lisp}

\M
We will use Lisp as our programming language, because it is
\emph{Eulerian} in nature.

\begin{code}
(defun meaning (life)
  "Return the computed meaning of LIFE"
  (let ((meh "abc"))
    ;; Invoke krakaboom
    (loop :for x :across meh
       :collect x)))

(defun partition (n coll)
  (declare (type integer n)
           (type (or cons nil) coll))
  (let ((results nil))
    (labels ((partition-inner (k lst)
               (if (and (plusp k)
                        (not (endp lst)))
                   (progn
                     (push (car lst) results)
                     (partition-inner (1- k) (cdr lst)))
                   (list (nreverse results) lst))
               ))
      (partition-inner n coll))))

(defun partition-by (pred? coll)
  (labels ((partition-inner (lst results)
             (if (funcall pred? (car lst))
                 (return-from partition-by (list (nreverse results) lst))
                 (if (endp lst)
                     (list results nil)
                     (partition-inner (cdr lst) (cons (car lst) results))))));;;
    (partition-inner coll nil)
    ;; results
    ))

(defun expand-hypothesis (th)
  "Transform `|- (and p q) => r' into `|- p => (q => r)'."
  (declare (type thm-implies th))
  (let* ((p-and-q (implies-premise (thm-statement th)))
         (p (car (l-and-conjuncts p-and-q)))
         (q (cadr (l-and-conjuncts p-and-q))))
    (assert (endp (cddr (l-and-conjuncts p-and-q))))
    (modus-ponens (reduce #'implies-add-assume
                          (l-and-conjuncts p-and-q)
                          :initial-value th
                          :from-end t)
                  (and-pair p q))))
