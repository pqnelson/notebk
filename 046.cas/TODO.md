In [thread](https://math.stackexchange.com/questions/2631783/physical-calculator-with-hyperreals-and-multiple-dimensions), a [reference](https://math.stackexchange.com/a/2634548) was made to:

- Shamseddine, Khodr. Analysis on the Levi-Civita field and computational applications. Appl. Math. Comput. 255 (2015), 44â€“57.

I should track this down.
