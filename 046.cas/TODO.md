This is just stuff to think about.

# Logarithms and Exponential Functions

Logarithms can be defined using $b > 0$ and $b\neq1$ as $\log_{b}(x)=a$
if $b^{a}=x$.

The power function can be defined easily enough for rational
exponents. We have $x^{1/m}=y$ if $y^{m}=x$ for any $m\in\mathbb{N}$.
Then $x^{m/n}=(x^{1/n})^{m}$.

Euler came about to natural logarithms and the constant $e$ as follows:
let $\varepsilon$ be an infinitesimal. Then consider
$x^{\varepsilon}$. We expect $x^{\varepsilon}\approx x^{0}=1$, but it
will be "off" by an infinitesimal amount, so $x^{\varepsilon} = 1 + \varepsilon y$.
We can see this by numerical experiment, with $\varepsilon$ taken to be
small but finite. Euler asked: when will $y=1$? It turns out when
$x=e$. This is the natural condition, and leads us to the natural logarithm.

In [thread](https://math.stackexchange.com/questions/2631783/physical-calculator-with-hyperreals-and-multiple-dimensions), a [reference](https://math.stackexchange.com/a/2634548) was made to:

I should track this down.
