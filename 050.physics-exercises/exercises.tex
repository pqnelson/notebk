\section{Introduction}

These are assorted exercises I've been thinking about. They should be
solvable, and related to further exercises. For the most part, the
inspiration for the exercises stem from particle physics, quantum
gravity, and climate science.

I've been thinking about Wheeler's geometrodynamics, which led to
wondering if quantum field theory ``recycles'' familiar physics
terminology (``mass'', ``spin'', etc.) in a way which is completely
disconnected from their intuitive meanings. This also led to me the
paper by Anderson and Brill~\cite{Anderson:1996pu} about geons, from
which I am certain exercises may be extracted.

Exercises are numbered sequentially. I may include remarks about an
exercise, each remark is ``subnumbered'' --- for example they look like
$\langle x\rangle.\langle r\rangle$ for remark number $r$ on exercise
numbered $x$.
