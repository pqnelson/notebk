\begin{exercise}[Stern--Gerlach, classically]
Suppose we have an inhomogeneous magnetic field $\vec{B}$.
Suppose we have a ``classical electron'' --- that is, a sphere of radius
$r_{e}$, mass $m_{e}$, uniform charge density which sums to a total
charge of $e$, uniform mass density, etc. Suppose further the
``classical electron'' is rotating about its direction of motion (i.e.,
the unit velocity vector for the electron).

If we send the classical electron through the inhomogeneous magnetic
field, then where will it end up? This is precisely the experimental
setup Stern and Gerlach devised, which was later interpreted as
measuring the spin of an electron.
