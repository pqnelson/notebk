\section{Extrinsic Curvature}

\begin{ddanger}
The conventions on the \textsc{sign} of extrinsic curvature varies wildly. I
believe I have a consistent choice, but it is possible I have erred.
\end{ddanger}

From the Hamiltonian perspective, the first step amounts to finding the
conjugate momentum. Ordinarily, these are just the time derivatives of
the generalized positions. For general relativity, with $q_{ij}$ as the
generalized positions, the time derivatives $\partial_{t}q_{ij}$ do not
suffice: they do not form a tensor. In general, the time derivatives of
the components of a tensor will not form a tensor.\footnote{This
motivation comes from Carlip~\cite{carlip2019}, which I find
compelling.} Thus we need to take a geometric detour.

If we have foliated space-time into spatial hypersurfaces $\Sigma_{t}$,
then we may consider unit normal 4-vectors $n^{\mu}$. The extrinsic
curvature may be computed using the Lie derivative of the 3-metric with
respect to $n^{\mu}$ as
\begin{equation}\label{eq:extrinsic-curvature:as-time-derivative-of-metric}
  \begin{split}
  K_{ij} &= \frac{-1}{2}(\mathcal{L}_{\mathbf{n}}q)_{ij}\\
  &= \frac{-1}{2}n^{\mu}\partial_{\mu}q_{ij} - \frac{1}{2} q_{\mu j}(\partial_{i}n^{\mu}) - \frac{1}{2} q_{i\mu}(\partial_{j}n^{\mu}),
  \end{split}
\end{equation}
where $\nabla_{\mu}$ is the covariant derivative compatible with the
4-metric $g_{\mu\nu}$, and we recall
\begin{equation}
q_{\mu\nu} = g_{\mu\nu} + n_{\mu}n_{\nu}.
\end{equation}
We may also consider $K_{ij}$ as the spatial  part of
\begin{equation}
K_{\mu\nu} = n_{(\mu;\nu)} = \frac{1}{2}(\nabla_{\mu}n_{\nu} + \nabla_{\nu}n_{\mu}).
\end{equation}
Both formulations make clear the extrinsic curvature tensor is
symmetric:
\begin{equation}
K_{ij} = K_{ji}.
\end{equation}

A third route to explain the extrinsic curvature tensor is simply by
considering the spatial projection of the covariant derivative of the unit
normal vector:
\begin{equation}
K_{\mu\nu} = {q_{\mu}}^{\rho}\nabla_{\rho}n_{\nu}.
\end{equation}
It requires invoking Frobenius's theorem (from differential topology) to
demonstrate this is a symmetric tensor field. We recall
\begin{equation}
n^{\mu}{q_{\mu}}^{\nu} = 0,
\end{equation}
which implies
\begin{equation}
K_{\mu\nu}n^{\mu} = 0.
\end{equation}
Thus this tensor is purely spatial.

However, the intuition of the extrinsic curvature is that it is the
``velocity'' corresponding to the 3-metric $q_{ij}$:
\begin{equation}
\boxed{K_{ij}\mathrel{\mbox{``=''}}\partial_{t}q_{ij}.}
\end{equation}
The strategy
\emph{now} is to rewrite the Ricci scalar for spacetime ${}^{(4)}R$ in
terms of the extrinsic curvature $K_{ij}$, spatial 3-curvature tensor
${}^{(3)}R_{ijk\ell}$, and spatial Ricci 3-tensor ${}^{(3)}R_{ij}$. This
will be used to write the Einstein--Hilbert Lagrangian in terms of
spatial tensors, then we will find the canonically conjugate momentum
$\pi^{ij}$ to the 3-metric $q_{ij}$, and continue on our merry way with
the Hamiltonian formalism.
