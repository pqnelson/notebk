\begin{abstract}
By spontaneously breaking conformal symmetry, a scalar field emerges
which we identify as the cosmological constant. The first instance is
in the Schwarzschild solution for the Weyl Gravity Field
Equations. The second is in the homogeneous and isotropic universe
with fermionic and bosonic matter. In the second case, an effective
gravitational constant emerges, as well as a positive cosmological
constant, both give theoretical justification within the conformal
gravity framework of an accelerating universe.
