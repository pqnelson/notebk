\section{Term Paper Topics}

Dr Carlip had, instead of a final, a 7--10 page term paper due for
Physics 260 (Classical General Relativity). The intention was to write
down an \emph{exposition} as opposed to some \emph{solution} to the
topic. The list of possible topics were:
\begin{enumerate}
\item Observational tests of general relativity
  \begin{enumerate}
  \item Binary pulsars and gravitational radiation
  \item ``Frame-dragging,'' gravitomagnetism, and Gravity Probe B
  \item ``Fifth force'' experiments and the principle of equivalence
  \item The Nordtvedt effect---the gravitational mass of gravitational energy
  \item LIGO, LISA, and plans for observation of gravitational radiation
  \item What we could learn about ``strong field gravity'' from
    gravitational waves
  \item The parametrized post-Newtonian (PPN) formalism
  \item Strong field tests from recently discovered pulsar-pulsar binary
  \item The ``speed of gravity''
  \item What can we learn from Lunar laser ranging?
  \item The Pioneer effect as a possible indication of new physics.
  \item Observations of binary stars and the DI Herculis puzzle (and
    possible solutions)
  \end{enumerate}
\item Classical General Relativity
  \begin{enumerate}
  \item Singularity theorems and ``cosmic censorship''
  \item The Einstein field equations as an initial value problem
  \item The Hamiltonian formulation of general relativity
  \item Mass in general relativity---ADM mass, Bondi mass, quasilocal mass
  \item Interior Schwarzschild solutions and gravitational collapse
  \item Black holes and ``isolated horizons''
  \item Mach's principle
  \item Approximation metods and the Einstein--Infeld--Hoffman equations
  \item ``Topological Censorship''
  \item Wormholes (the science, not the science fiction)
  \item Causality, closed timelike curves, and ``chronology protection''
  \item The Kerr metric
  \end{enumerate}
\item Astrophysics and Cosmology
  \begin{enumerate}
  \item The cosmological constant and dark energy
  \item Astrophysical evidence for black holes
  \item Black hole mergers---numerical simulations and predictions
  \item Astrophysical sources of gravitational radiation
  \item How good is the evidence that the Universe is homogeneous and isotropic?
  \item The topology of the Universe?
  \item General relativity, R mode, and the stability of neutron stars
  \item Growth of perturbation in cosmology
  \item Inflation vs the ``cyclic model/ekpyrotic universe'' (but make
    sure the paper is about general relativity!)
  \item Modified Newtonian Dynamics (MOND) or TeVeS and general relativity
  \end{enumerate}
\item Quantum Gravity
  \begin{enumerate}
  \item Initial conditions and the ``wave function of the universe''
  \item The Wheeler--DeWitt equation
  \item The connection formalism and loop quantum gravity
  \item The ``problem of time'' in quantum gravity
  \item Black hole thermodynamics and Hawking radiation
  \item The ``holographic principle'' and quantum gravity
  \item Quantum fields in simple and curved spacetimes
  \item The Casimir effect and curved spacetime
  \item Negative energy and quantum energy conditions
  \item ``Acceleration radiation'' and the Unruh effect
  \item The AdS/CFT correspondence
  \item Arguments for and against minimum length
  \item Asymptotic safety (only do this if you already know some QFT)
  \item General relativity as an effective field theory (again only if
    you already know some QFT)
  \end{enumerate}
\item Gravity and other interactions/alternative theories
  \begin{enumerate}
  \item String theory and general relativity
  \item Relativity in more than four dimensions: Kaluza--Klein theories
  \item Relativity in more than four dimensions: ``brane worlds'' and
    TeV-scale gravity
  \item Does gravity act as an ultraviolet cutoff?
  \item Theories with nonsymmetric metrics
  \item Theories with torsion and nonmetricity
  \item Spinors in general relativity
  \item Scalar--Tensor theories
  \item Broken Lorentz invariance and ``Einstein--Aether theories''
  \item Horava--Lifshitz theories and anisotropic scaling
  \item Massive gravity and the van Dam--Veltman--Zakharov discontinuity
  \item Higher dimensional gravity
  \end{enumerate}
\end{enumerate}
