Great books to consult while reading these notes include:
\begin{enumerate}[label={[\arabic*]}]
\item Barrett O'Neill, \emph{Elementary Differential Geometry}.
Revised Second edition, Academic Press, 2006. (\textbf{Caution}: O'Neill's
notation can be odd at times, like writing the transpose of a matrix as
${}^{t}\!M$ instead of $M^{T}$ or $M^{\top}$.)
\item Manfredo do Carmo,
  \emph{Differential Geometry of Curves and Surfaces}.
  Revised and Updated Second Edition, Dover, 2016.
