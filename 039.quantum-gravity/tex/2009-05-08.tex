We need the spatial topology to not change, otherwise we can end up with
a number of baby universes (``polymer topology'').

Let us consider the simplest spin network, we need 2 nodes and 3
edges. (If we had 2 edges, then we would obtain the identity spin
network.)
We don't have spin 0, as the propagator would be the identity.

For each of these lines we have the Wilson line
\begin{equation}
\mathcal{U} = \mathcal{P}\exp[-\int A].
\end{equation}
We have three Wilson lines ${\mathcal{U}^{m_{1}}_{1}}_{n_{1}}$,
${\mathcal{U}^{m_{2}}_{2}}_{n_{2}}$, and ${\mathcal{U}^{m_{3}}_{3}}_{n_{3}}$.
Conceptually, the $\mathcal{U}$'s tell spin-$1/2$ objects rotate in spin
space. We have $m_{1}=1/2, -1/2$ for spin up and spin down (respectively).
We see $m_{2}$ also describes a spin-$1/2$ object, but $m_{3}$ describes
a spin-1 object with possible values $m_{3}=-1,0,+1$. We can now use the
Clebsch--Gordon coefficients $\langle j\,m\mid j_{1}\,m_{1}\,, j_{2}\,m_{2}\rangle$
and find
\begin{equation}
  \sum_{\substack{m_{1},m_{2},m_{3}\\ n_{1},n_{2},n_{3}}}
  {\mathcal{U}^{m_{1}}_{1}}_{n_{1}}{\mathcal{U}^{m_{2}}_{2}}_{n_{2}}{\mathcal{U}^{m_{3}}_{3}}_{n_{3}}
\langle1\,m_{3}\mid\frac{1}{2}\,m_{1}\,\frac{1}{2}m_{2}\rangle
\langle1\,n_{3}\mid\frac{1}{2}\,n_{1}\,\frac{1}{2}n_{2}\rangle,
\end{equation}
which is a function of $A$.

We take a surface $\Sigma$, we can ask ``What is the area of the
surface?'' Suppose we have some spin network that ``goes through'' our
surface $\Sigma$:
\begin{center}
  \includegraphics{img/2009-05-08.2}
\end{center}
We won't consider an edge of the spin network ``grazing'' the surface,
or lies inside the surface: we care about puncturing edges.

We will only really consider a simple example choosing a surface where
$x^{3}=0$, the area of the surface would be classically
\begin{equation}
A = \int\sqrt{{}^{(2)}g}\D^{2}x.
\end{equation}
We see
\begin{equation}
{}^{(2)}g = g_{11}g_{22} - 2(g_{12})^{2} = \widetilde{E}^{3}_{\widehat{I}} \widetilde{E}^{3\widehat{I}}.
\end{equation}
So the area is
\begin{equation}
A = \int\sqrt{\widetilde{E}^{3}_{\widehat{I}} \widetilde{E}^{3\widehat{I}}}\D^{2}x.
\end{equation}
Consider a more general surface with coordinates $\sigma^{1}$, $\sigma^{2}$.
Then our considerations change by
\begin{equation}
\widetilde{E}^{3}_{\phantom{3}\widehat{I}}\to\epsilon_{ijk}\frac{\partial x^{i}}{\partial\sigma^{1}}\frac{\partial x^{j}}{\partial\sigma^{2}}\widetilde{E}^{k}_{\phantom{k}\widehat{I}}.
\end{equation}
In the classical arena, the criteria for a ``small region'' is not
really well-defined; in the quantum arena, we just require a single
piercing of a spin network with the surface.\marginpar{\includegraphics{img/2009-05-08.3}} We can turn this now into an
operator
\begin{equation}
\widetilde{E}_{\widehat{I}} = -8\pi G_{N}\immirzi\int\epsilon_{ijk}\frac{\partial x^{i}}{\partial\sigma^{1}}\frac{\partial x^{j}}{\partial\sigma^{2}}\frac{\delta}{\delta
A^{\widehat{I}}_{k}}\,\D\sigma^{1}\D\sigma^{2}.
\end{equation}
