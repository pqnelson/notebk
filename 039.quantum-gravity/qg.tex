\section*{Introduction}
These are my notes on quantum gravity taken from Steve Carlip's course during Spring Quarter of 2010 at UC Davis. Lectures were on Wednesdays and Fridays.
Any errors or typos are mine. I have opted to include the inline citations, which Carlip gave in class, and collected them in the end in the references section.

I have tried to correct some small idiosyncracies in my notes, like
referring to the wave functional as a wave function.
