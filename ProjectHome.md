This is just my collection of notes on math and physics.

The scope of the notes vary. It ranges from theoretical physics (classical general relativity and quantum gravity, quantum field theory, etc.) to pure mathematics.

I hope, someday, to have these notes form a cohesive collection --- similar to Bourbaki's _Elements of Mathematics_ ... except I want my notes to be coherent.

If you are interested in the TeX/LaTeX macros used, see the [wiki entry](http://code.google.com/p/notebk/wiki/TeXMacros) on them. All explanations and example code are given.

It also consists of my numerical analysis programs which model physical phenomena. These are written in C/C++ (or more accurately, C-like C++). They are GPL'd.

**Related Projects:** there is a similar project, "[Mad Math Notes](http://code.google.com/p/madmathnotes/)," which are mathematical notes from courses at the University of Wisconsin at Madison. `Mad Math Notes` appears to be strictly based on lectures at the university, whereas we attempt to have a self-contained series of notes here.

**To Aspiring Mathematical Writers:** if you are starting out with your own Googlecode project to store your own notes, please see my [Advice](Advice.md) and [Organization](Organization.md) wiki pages. I think the latter helps especially!
