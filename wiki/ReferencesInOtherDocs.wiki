#summary Just some notes on packages dealing with references in other documents.

= Introduction =

Frequently I will set up my notes to be such that I have references to other notes I have written. So, e.g., my notes on infinite-dimensional Lie Algebras may refer to theorems and definitions from my notes on Lie Groups, Lie Algebras, and Representations. What to do? 

One way we can deal with "external references" is to use `xr`, `xr-hyper`, or `zref`. This was noted on the [http://www.tex.ac.uk/cgi-bin/texfaq2html?label=extref TeX FAQ] page.

After fiddling around a little, it seems that `xr-hyper`. It is designed to work specifically with `hyperref` and `PDFLaTeX`. The example usage:

{{{
\usepackage{xr-hyper}
\usepackage{hyperref}
\externaldocument[V1-]{volume1}[http://mybook.com/volume1.pdf]
...
... the \nameref{V1-introduction})...
}}}
