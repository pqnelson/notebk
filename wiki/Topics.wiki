= Introduction =
These are just a collection of topics and references of interesting stuff to look into...

= Representation Theory =

All of physics boils down to trivial problems in representation theory.

= Moonshine =
Moonshine is a peculiar topic, because it is "some relationship" between "modular stuff" and "algebraic stuff".

== Finite simple groups and the Monster ==
This is often dismissed as "too simple" a subject to even discuss: finite simple groups are completely classified, thus trivial.

The sporadic groups [viz. the Pariahs + the monster] and twisted finite groups are particularly interesting (in that, they are not like the other finite simple groups).

But still there are a few good references:

  # Michael Aschbacher, _Sporadic Groups_
  # -----, _Finite Group Theory_
== Modular functions and Hauptmoduls ==
Modular functions are a sticky subject to discuss.

The Poincare half-plane is important to discuss, as is the modular group. 

Weierstrass' elliptic function ℘ is also an important object to study. Apostol takes the approach of studying doubly periodic functions in the complex plane, then examining some examples.

Serge Lang's book on elliptic functions might be worth while to look into...

Cousins of Weierstrass' ℘ includes Dedekind's eta function, Jacobi's theta function, the j-invariant, and Eisenstein series.

Such functions emerged from considering inverse functions for elliptic integrals.

== Vertex operator algebras ==
There is no good book on this, in my opinion. There are some good approaches, but no good books.

*Dependencies:* Topological QFT (for the algebraic approach), Wightman Axioms (for the analytical approach).

=McKay Correspondence=
This relates various finite groups --- well, finite subgroups of SU(2,*C*) --- to various Lie groups.

What are the finite subgroups of SU(2,*C*)? Well, there are several:
  # Cyclic groups
  # Binary dihedral group
  # Binary Tetrahedral group
  # Binary Octahedral group
  # Binary Dodecahedral group
and no others. See Yi Sun's [http://web.mit.edu/yisun/www/talks/mckay.pdf The McKay Correspondence] (pdf, 4 pages).

Miles Reid has done some work generalizing it, working with finite subgroups of SL(3,*C*).

= Quantum Field Theory =

This is a subject that, quite frankly, no one _understands_ but people formally manipulate in a prescribed manner.

In particular, the different approaches to functional integration seems interesting.

== Canonical Formalism ==

This approach uses Hilbert spaces in the obvious way. It runs into problems due to the von Hove-Groenewald theorem.
