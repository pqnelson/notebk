#summary Notes and web-resources on Formal Mathematics.

= Introduction =

This is just a collection of resources on formal mathematics. Formal mathematics is basically mathematics presented in a purely "symbolic way." So, imagine we had some programming language that we use to express mathematics...that's formalized mathematics in a nutshell.

It would be nice if someone could write a proof checker for structured proofs (*cough*hint*hint*cough*)...

Of course, what would be ideal --- if it turns out the author is too lazy to learn Coq, Mizar, Isar, etc. --- is to figure out how to translate a structured proof easily into a declarative proof. That way, it would be trivial (almost mechanical) translating structured proofs into a machine-checkable program.

== Mathematical Vernacular ==

Frank Wiedijk wrote a short [http://www.cs.ru.nl/~freek/notes/mv.pdf note (pdf)] on what de Bruijn called "mathematical vernacular". The idea is kind of similar to a structured proof, in the sense [http://research.microsoft.com/en-us/um/people/lamport/pubs/pubs.html#lamport-how-to-write Lamport]. 

Wiedijk introduces a formal grammar for certain "[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reserved_word Reserved Words]" which indicate some rule of inference (take from natural deduction). It is tempting to start using such "vernacular" in structured proofs, but...well, it's something to think about.

  * [http://www.cs.ru.nl/~freek/notes/mv.pdf The Mathematical Vernacular (pdf)] *Abstract.* A "mathematical vernacular" is a formal language for writing mathematical proofs which resembles the natural language from mathematical texts. A number of systems (Hyperproof, Mizar, Isabelle/Isar) all basically have the same proof language. It consists of the combination of natural deduction with first order inference steps. In this note we compare these three languages and present a simplified common version. (9 pp.) 
  * [http://www.cs.ru.nl/~freek/notes/newman.pdf The formal proof sketch challenge (pdf)] *Abstract.* A _formal proof sketch_ is a way to present a formal proof in a style that is close to an informal proof, but which also is a skeleton of the full formal proof (this makes it easy to relate the presentation to the detailed formalization.) Recently to us every informal proof has started to feel like a _challenge_, to write down the corresponding formal proof sketch. We take on this challenge for the informal proof of _Newman's lemma_ from Henk Barendregt's book about lambda-calculus. The specific difficulty of that proof is its main part, which just is a pair of diagrams without any explanation. (15 pp.)
