#summary Notes and web-resources on Formal Mathematics.

= Introduction =

This is just a collection of resources on formal mathematics. Formal mathematics is basically mathematics presented in a purely "symbolic way." So, imagine we had some programming language that we use to express mathematics...that's formalized mathematics in a nutshell.

It would be nice if someone could write a proof checker for structured proofs (*cough*hint*hint*cough*)...
