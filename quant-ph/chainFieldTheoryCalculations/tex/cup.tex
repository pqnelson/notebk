For the next situation, we'll consider the doodle on the
left. That is, it's...well, a cup. Dual to the picture before,
where from the void there came about a cap, here from a cup
begath the void. We expect this to be remarkably similar to the
calculation we just performed. We should consider the initial
state to be described by the chain
\begin{equation}%\label{eq:}
\mathbb{Z}^{n_{v}}\leftarrow \mathbb{Z}^{n_{e}}
\end{equation}
where $n_v$, $n_e$ are the number of vertices and edges
(respectively). The final state is the vacuous one
\begin{equation}%\label{eq:}
\mathbb{Z}^{\emptyset}\leftarrow\mathbb{Z}^{\emptyset}
\end{equation}
since there are no edges or vertices, we have to work with the
empty set! Putting together everything we know, we get the chain
complex
\begin{equation}%\label{eq:}
\begin{CD}
\mathbb{Z}^{1} @<<< \mathbb{Z}^{1}\\
@VVV                 @VVV\\
\mathbb{Z}^{1} @<<< \mathbb{Z}^{1} @<<< \mathbb{Z}^{1}\\
@AAA                 @AAA\\
\mathbb{Z}^{\emptyset} @<<< \mathbb{Z}^{\emptyset}.
\end{CD}
\end{equation}
Where we have taken advantage of the obvious: there is one vertex
and one edge in the initial state.

We see that the Hilbert spaces describing the initial and the
final states are precisely those from the corresponding component
from the previous computation. That is, the initial state is
$L^{2}(U(1))$ and the final state is described by the Hilbert
space $\mathbb{C}$. We can similarly choose our favorite states
from each space ($e^{ikA}$ and 1 respectively).
