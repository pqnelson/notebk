Loosely speaking, basic topology is concerned with
boundaries. What is an open set? When is a set ``in one piece''?
When can we ``put'' a set ``inside a box''? What is a
``boundary''? What is a ``neighborhood''? And so on.

The basic approach to introducing topology will be done in three
acts. The first act will introduce what is a topology, basic
definitions, various operations on sets, neighborhoods, and bases
for topologies. The second act will deal with the construction of
topological spaces, specifically subspaces and product
spaces. The third will deal with a variety of properties a
topological space can have (e.g. compactness, connectedness,
countability and seperation axioms, etc.).
